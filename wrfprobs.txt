Hi, So I am having trouble getting WRF-Hydro to run with both the following configurations:
1.  removing all the previous /usr/local/ include,bin,lib files
	gcc version 4.8.2
	netcdf-3.6.3 (recommended in wrf-hydro documentation). No other dependencies were mentioned
	./configure=/usr/local ; make; make check; sudo make install : All successful
	wrf hydro compiles!
	
Previously noted error that didnt occur this time
PROBLEM1: 
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/idasgupt/hydro'
(cd Data_Rec     ; make -f Makefile)
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/idasgupt/hydro/Data_Rec'
cpp -C -P -xassembler-with-cpp -traditional -I"../Data_Rec" -DHYDRO_D -DWRF_HYDRO  -I/usr/local/include module_namelist.F > module_namelist.f
gfortran -o module_namelist.o -w -c -ffree-form -ffree-line-length-none -fconvert=big-endian -frecord-marker=4  -I./ -I../mod -I../mod module_namelist.f

SOLUTION
Go to hydro/Data_Rec
vim macros
In CPPFLAGS remove '-C'

Also, one of the configurations that worked for Seongjin: 
gcc 4.9.1
g++ 
gfortran 4.9.1

curl 
zlib 1.2.8
hdf5 1.8.16
netcdf 4.3.3.1
netcdf-fortran 4.4.2
